$$
\begin{align}
\mathscr{L} = \mathscr{L} +c \\
\mathscr{L} = c\mathscr{L}
\end{align}
$$
In effect, because when we use the Euler Lagrange equation, nothing changes. 

because there are derivatives, so the changes wouldn't have any effect.
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dt} \frac{ d \mathscr{L}}{d \dot{x} } = \frac{ d \mathscr{L}}{d x } 
\end{align}
$$
If we consider a free particle with $\vec{F}=0$, $\mathscr{L}=T + \text{ constant potential } = T$
