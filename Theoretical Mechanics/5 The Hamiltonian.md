The Hamiltonian is conserved if $\frac{ \partial \mathscr{L} }{ \partial t }=0$. 

$$
\begin{align}
H = \left( \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \frac{ \partial \mathscr{L} }{ \partial \dot{q}_{i}  } \dot{q} \right) \, \, - \mathscr{L} 
\end{align}
$$


The Hamiltonian is not always just the mechanical energy - if the system is driven (i.e. some external constraint).

For example: The bead on a rotating hoop (of constant azimuthal rate $\omega_{0}$) wasn't explicitly time dependent, but because it was driven, the theta vector pointed differently in space over time. So H is conserved, but $H=T+U-mg\sin ^{2}\theta x^{2}$ which is not $T+U$.
