Defects in crystal structure lead to defect modes for phonons. 

Tunneling model: Particles have two ground states that they can tunnel between
*we have equivalent ground state motifs which would make this a useful model*

Low frequency phonons are absorbed by defects for them to change state *(fall into a higher energy? Or push them past activation barrier to then fall into a ground state, releasing more energy?)*

Low frequency phonon modes

ratio between phonon wavelength $\lambda$ to the phonon mean free path is typically $10^{-3} \text{ to } 10^{-2}$
