#Phylogenetic_trees: 
A phylogenetic tree, also known as a phylogeny, is aÂ diagram that depicts the lines of evolutionary descent of different species, organisms, or genes.
The tree has two types of nodes.
1) Tips(leaves): species or groups whose relationships were representing
2) Internal nodes: most recent common ancestor
3) A #Clade requires that all descendant species are included up to the highest animal in the clade
4) Trees can be drawn slightly differently, the main information that they portray is the clades that exist. IE. the groups of linked descendants.

 We can get information about the way characteristics evolved by mapping changes onto a tree, separating descendants with/without a trait. 

We can compare genome sequences to figure out where on the phylogenetic tree something lies.
