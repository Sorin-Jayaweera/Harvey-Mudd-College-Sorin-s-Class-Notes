We use the log likelihood ratio to predict which open reading frames are coding for real genes vs aren't. We can then take a real sample and determine what sections are being translated into genes and which aren't, and then compare these two bins.

We can compare the quality of our prediction by using 
$$
\frac{\text{ true positives }}{\text{ predicted positives }}
$$
which we want to maximize.
