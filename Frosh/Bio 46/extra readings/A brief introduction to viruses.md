Viruses are biological entities that infect cells, using the host cell’s machinery to replicate themselves.

### Comparing viruses with cells

We’ll begin by contrasting viruses with cells (you should have done a reading on cells last week). One obvious difference is that viruses are much smaller. A typical human cell might be on the order of 10,000 nm in diameter. A bacterial cell might be about 2,000 nm long. Viruses are typically in the tens or hundreds of nm. HIV for example is about 100 nm in diameter, and some things like the polio virus are even smaller (~25 nm).

The internal properties of viruses and cells are also strikingly different. A fundamental characteristic of cells is they are able to grow and divide. That is, the physical structure of the cell changes over time depending on the conditions it finds itself in. In contrast, a viral particle is assembled once, and (for the most part) does not change after that. It is like a box with some things put inside. At some point the box will be opened. But while it is closed, it’s mostly unchanging.

Another contrast is metabolism. Cells carry out a wide array of chemical reactions in order to build all (or most) of the molecules they need. This web of reactions is called metabolism. Viruses do not have metabolism. They don’t carry out chemical reactions to make things. Instead, they parasitize cells. They rely on cells to provide them the various raw materials and machinery they need to reproduce.
### Virus parts
 

Let’s now talk about the components of a virus. Most viruses are composed of three major parts:  the genome, a protein coat that surrounds the genome called a capsid, and in some cases, a phospholipid bilayer membrane that surrounds the capsid.

Viruses have a nucleic acid genome. In some, this is made of DNA, like in cells. But in other viruses it is made of RNA. HIV has an RNA genome. The nucleic acid genome of a virus can be double stranded or single stranded. It can be a single molecule, or sometimes more than one molecule. Like a cell however, the genes in a viral genome encode proteins.


The capsid is a protein coat which encloses the viral genome, and protects it from the environment. It is made of many repeating protein units. In some viruses, there is just a single kind of protein. In others there may be several. Capsids take on a variety of shapes. A common one is an icosahedron—that is a polyhedron with 20 triangular faces. There are also viruses with helical capsid shapes, and a variety of others.

Some viruses also have an envelope, a membrane surrounding the capsid. HIV is an example of a virus with an envelope. This envelope is made of the same lipid bilayer as found in host cells, and indeed it originates from host cells. There are often virus specific proteins which are present in this membrane, which are involved in helping the virus recognize and get into new host cells.
### Virus replication cycles

A virus’ replication cycle is the process by which it enters a cell and replicates itself. We’ll start with a simple example, called a lytic replication cycle. This sort can be found, for example, in viruses that infect bacteria. Here’s a diagram:

The viral genome is the green squiggly line, and the capsid is the red hexagon that surrounds it.  First a viral particle is exposed to a suitable host cell. It manages to get itself into the cell and the genome is released from the capsid. Next, using host cell machinery, the genome replicates itself and also makes more viral proteins, including proteins to make up new capsids. All these new genomes and viral proteins are then assembled into new viral particles. Finally, viral particles are released, and in the process the host cell is destroyed.

There are other types of replication cycles. Some viruses actually insert their own genome into the genome of the host cell. Here’s a diagram of this kind of replication cycle:

The virus (this time surrounded by an envelope) enters the host cell. But instead of making more copies of itself immediately, it inserts or copies its genome into the host cell’s genome (represented by the straight blue line). The copy of the virus in the host genome is called a provirus. From that position it is able to use host cell machinery for transcription and translation (discussed in the previous reading) to make new viral genomes and proteins. These assemble into new viral particles, which then exit the cell. The illustration above shows a new virus “budding off” from the host cell. Often viruses of this type are able to produce new particles and get them outside the cell without immediately destroying that cell. One of the features of this replication cycle is that the virus is able to persist in the host cell. Once in the genome, it cannot be removed. And in fact if the host cell replicates, the provirus will be replicated along with the host genome. HIV is an example of a virus that operates this way. We’ll say more about the details of its replication cycle in class.

### Human viruses

Finally it is worth saying that human viruses typically specialize in certain cell types or tissues. For example, cold viruses infect the upper respiratory tract, viruses that cause “stomach flu” infect the gastrointestinal tract, and the hepatitis B virus infects the liver. In the case of HIV, the major target of infection is the immune system.
