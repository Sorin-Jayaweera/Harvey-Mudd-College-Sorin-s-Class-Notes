This is intended to provide general background on some key biological molecules. These molecules will come up many times during the semester. You do not need to memorize their structures. But you will need to know what we’re talking about when we say “amino acid side chain”, “base pair”, “5’ end” etc.

  

Many of the most important molecules in biology are polymers—large molecules made up of a series of similar repeating units called monomers. Polymers are important because they are easy to build, but can nevertheless take on a variety of structures and functions. We will discuss two examples below: nucleic acids and protein.

## Nucleic acids

Nucleic acids such as RNA and DNA are the primary information storage molecules in biology. They are polymers made up of repeating monomer units called nucleotides. Here is an illustration of a nucleotide:

Note that for visual simplicity, the carbons in this representation (and any hydrogens bonded to them) are not explicitly drawn. They occur where two lines meet and another atom is not drawn.


A nucleotide has several parts:

The basic element is a five-carbon sugar molecule. In DNA this five-carbon sugar is deoxyribose; in RNA it is ribose. What’s being shown here is deoxyribose. By convention the carbons in the sugar are numbered as indicated. The difference between ribose and deoxyribose is that ribose has an additional OH on the 2’ (read “2 prime”) carbon. 

  
The 5’ and 3’ carbons in the sugar give the nucleotide an orientation, and we can speak of its 5’ end (the end with the 5 carbon) or its 3’ end (the end with the three carbon). The illustration above has the 5’ end on top, and the 3’ end on the bottom.

Attached to the sugar is a phosphate group at the 5’ carbon. At the 1’ carbon is a ringed organic molecule with a nitrogen in it, called a base. Here the base is adenine. There are four types of base in RNA: adenine, guanine, cytosine and uracil. DNA also has four, but with thymine instead of uracil.

Nucleotide monomers can be joined when the phosphate group bound to the 5’ carbon of one nucleotide forms a covalent bond with the 3’ carbon of another. Here is an example of three nucleotides bonded together (a thymine and two adenines).

Note that this three nucleotide polymer has an orientation defined by the carbons on its sugars. It has a 5’ end (the end with the 5’ carbons) and the 3’ end (the end with the 3’ carbons). In this illustration, the 5’ end is drawn on top the 3’ end on the bottom.

Nucleotide polymers can be extremely long. For example, human chromosome 1 is a DNA molecule 250 million nucleotides long.

DNA is a two stranded molecule. That is, it consists of two individual nucleic acid polymers which are hydrogen bonded to each other:

ref:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/DNA_chemical_structure.svg/450px-DNA_chemical_structure.svg.png

The bases of the two strands pair with each other. Adenine pairs with thymine by forming two hydrogen bonds. And cytosine and guanine can bind by forming three hydrogen bonds. These pairings are specific, because the geometry of the bases makes it so that other pairs, for example C and A, do not bond as stably. Base pairing is the basis of information storage and transmission in cells.

When we are talking about double stranded DNA molecules like chromosomes, we sometimes use base pairs (bp) as a unit of length. Thus we could say that human chromosome 1 is 250 million bp long.

Note that the two paired strands are anti-parallel—that is, they are in opposite orientation. In the illustration above, the strand on the left has the 3' end on the bottom. In contrast, the strand it is paired with has the 3' end on top. 

## Proteins

Proteins are another example of a biological polymer. They are the chief molecules that do things in cells. They have an enormous variety of functions including enzymatic (catalyzing chemical reactions), structural, transport and many more.

The monomer units of proteins are amino acids. This is the structure of an amino acid:

It has a carbon atom at its center, called the alpha carbon. The alpha carbon is attached to four things: an amino group (NH2, on left above) and a carboxyl group (COOH, on right above), an R group (sometimes also called a side chain, and discussed further below), and a hydrogen.

Amino acids monomers can combine as illustrated below. In this reaction the amino group of one amino acid reacts with the carboxyl group of another giving off a water and forming a covalent bond, called a peptide bond.

Cells often join hundreds of amino acids together in a chain to form a protein.  

The structure of a protein—that is its three dimensional shape—defines its function. Proteins with similar structures tend to do similar things.  A protein’s structure is, in turn, determined by the chemical properties of the amino acids present in it. In living organisms there are 20 different kinds of amino acids that are primarily used in making protein. Each of these is defined by a different side chain (R group):

Different R groups have different chemical properties. Some are hydrophilic (soluble in water) others hydrophobic (not soluble in water) and so on. They confer their chemical properties on the amino acids they are attached to. You do not need to memorize this table—the point is to understand that the different R groups confer certain chemical properties on the amino acids that contain them.


Once a cell has synthesized a chain of amino acids, that chain begins to fold up into a particular three dimensional structure. This folding process is strongly influenced by the amino acid side chains and their chemical properties. A protein with a particular sequence of amino acids will fold into a particular shape. Based on that shape, it will be capable of a particular function.
