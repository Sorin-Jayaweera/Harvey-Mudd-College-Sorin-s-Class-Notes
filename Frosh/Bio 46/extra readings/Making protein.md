Organisms ranging from bacteria to humans store their genetic information in DNA. The most important component of this information is instructions for making protein. In this section we will discuss the process by which cells create protein from DNA instructions.

  

It will be important to be familiar with this process during our section on HIV because of its importance for the HIV life cycle. The HIV virus does not have its own mechanism for creating protein—thus it must rely on human cell processes to do so.

  

## Outline of the process

The cell takes information stored in DNA and uses it to make protein in three main steps.

First, it creates an RNA copy of the DNA sequence coding for the protein. This is called transcription. Second it uses that RNA as a guide for constructing a linear chain of amino acids. This process is called translation. Third, the linear chain of amino acids folds into a particular three dimensional shape with an associated function.

  

## DNA to RNA (transcription)

  

A gene is a region of DNA which carries the instructions for making a protein. To make a protein from a particular gene, the cell first creates an RNA copy of that gene, called a messenger RNA or mRNA.

  

This requires the cell to synthesize an RNA polymer composed of multiple RNA nucleotides bonded together. The chemical reaction for adding one RNA nucleotide onto another is shown here:

The cell polymerizes RNA nucleotides in their triphosphate form where each nucleotide has three phosphate groups attached to its 5’ carbon. (The illustration above shows deoxyadenosine triphosphate on top. This can be referred to as dATP for short. The other three possible DNA nucleotide triphosphates are dGTP, dTTP and dCTP).

  

At the 3' end of the growing RNA strand there is a OH group. The oxygen from this group will attach to the first phosphate, giving off the two remaining phosphates as a molecule of pyrophosphate (two phosphates bonded together). So a growing polymer of RNA grows 5' to 3'. It turns out both DNA and RNA polymers grow this way in cells.

  

Cells catalyze this chemical reaction with an enzyme (that is, a protein catalyst) called RNA polymerase.

  

RNA polymerase works by moving along one of the DNA strands, called the template strand. At each position it adds an RNA nucleotide complementary to the DNA nucleotide on the template. This is made possible because of the base pairing rules for nucleic acids.

In this example RNA polymerase has already added seven bases and is preparing to add the eighth, which will be a U. (Remember RNA uses U instead of T). One thing to notice from this example is that the new RNA strand grows anti-parallel to the template DNA strand. The RNA strand is growing in the 5’ to 3’ direction, while the template strand is being read in the 3’ to 5’ direction.

## RNA to protein (translation)

  

The sequence of nucleotides in the mRNA contains information representing the linear order of amino acids for a particular protein. The cell’s machinery is able to read this and use it to construct the protein.

### The genetic code

Because there are twenty major amino acids, but only four nucleotides, the cell uses a triplet code to map between nucleotides and amino acids. This is called the genetic code. It consists of a mapping between units of three nucleotides, called codons, and amino acids. 

  

The genetic code is given in the table below. In row 2 column 2 for example, we see that the codon UUU corresponds to the amino acid phenylalanine (abbreviated phe, or simply F). Because there are more codons than there are amino acids, multiple codons can code for the same amino acid. For example, in addition to UUU, the codon UUC also codes for phenylalanine. Other amino acids have four or even six codons that code for them. The table is organized so that rows correspond to the first nucleotide in a codon, and columns correspond to the second nucleotide.

In addition to specifying the twenty major amino acids, the genetic code also includes a start codon (AUG) and three stop codons (UAA, UAG, and UGA). These are signals that tell the cell’s protein building machinery where to start and stop assembling amino acids. We should note that the start codon also codes for an amino acid, methionine, and thus most proteins begin with a methionine. The stop codons do not code for any amino acid.

### An example mRNA

  

Below we show the sequence of a human mRNA. This comes from a gene (TLR1) important in the immune system. We’ll discuss the immune system in more detail later in the course. Within the sequence of this mRNA we have highlighted in red the region which codes for protein. It consists of a start codon, AUG, followed by a series of other codons, and ending in a stop codon (UAG in this case). It is 2361 nucleotides long—however the last three are a stop codon and do not code for protein. Note that the start codon, AUG, also codes for the protein methionine. So the region codes for 2358 / 3, or 786 amino acids.

### A few other details...

  

There are many details we will not discuss at this point, however it is worth briefly mentioning a few other things.

  

The cell uses a molecular machine called the ribosome to construct proteins. The ribosome binds to an mRNA and proceeds along it codon by codon. As it moves, it uses special RNA molecules called tRNAs to help it recognize each codon and to bring in the proper amino acid which should be associated with that codon. The ribosome then catalyzes the formation of a covalent bond (called a peptide bond) between the next amino acid and the growing protein.

  

As the linear chain of amino acids is being constructed, the chain immediately begins to fold into the final protein. This process is influenced by the chemical properties of the amino acids and most importantly by their side chains. Protein folding is the crucial step at which the molecule finally adopts a particular three dimensional shape, and thus a particular function.
