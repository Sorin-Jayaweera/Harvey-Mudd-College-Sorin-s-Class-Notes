## Enzymes, Inhibitors, and AZT
Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme that takes an RNA template and synthesizes new DNA.

The first drug that was used to treat HIV was Azidothymidine. It was developed as a cancer drug, but was retried for HIV infections. It is similar to Thymidine (DNA nucleotide), but it has an Azide group instead of the OH. No more nucleotides can be added on past the #AZT, as the OH is required. Host cells don't make the mistake as much as the reverse transcriptase, which is what makes this a viable drug to stop the spread of HIV.

The immediate results seemed promising as it reduced the viral load well in the beginning. Over time, though, AZT looses effectiveness.
Doctors took samples over periods of time, and found that over time more AZT is needed to get the same effect. Eventually too much would be toxic.

This happens because HIV evolves resistance to the drug. 
## Nucleotide substitution rate
We can simulate new mutations over generations. A mutation can die and be lost, it could die, or the population could be polymorphic. In the long term, it will either be fixed(100%) or lost (0%).

The probability of an allele being fixed is just the frequency in a generation. For a newly introduced allele with no difference in fitness, its probability of being fixed is $\frac{1}{n}$.

Let $\mu$ be a chance of mutation per neucleitide.

$\frac{\mu*\text{mutations}}{\text{site } * \text{ replication}}$

## mechanisms of sequence evolution

we can represent evolution inside a patient with phylogenetic trees, or a sample of multiple patients and build a tree.
