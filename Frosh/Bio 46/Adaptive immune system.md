Humoral immunity:
- Immunity in liquid
	- B-cells, antibodies
- Cellular immunity
	- antigens

Antibodies are made of 4 proteins, two heavy chains and two light chains. Antibodies heavy chains are made by selecting a single V segment, a single D segment, and a single J segment at random when copying. By combinatorics, it is possible to make a lot of unique antibodies. 
There are 51 V segments, 27 D segments, and 6 J segments, + a lot of constant region segments in the heavy chain.

For light chains, there are 40 v segments and 5 j segments, and the same VDJ recombination is done for the,.  

Antibody specificity is determined by 
* V D and J regions of the heavy chain.
* V and J regions of light chain
