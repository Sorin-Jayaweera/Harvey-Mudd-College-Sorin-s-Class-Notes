A) Because there is a net force, linear momentum is not conserved. However, angular momentum is conserved. This is because the rope always has tension pointing radially inwards, so $R\times \tau_{r}=0$. 
Energy is also conserved, as all forces are generated internally, so energy transfers from the movement of the block to the stretching of the spring. 

The initial angular momentum of the block is
$$
\begin{align}
L_{orb}=mv_{0}d\\
L_{rot} = 0
\end{align}
$$

A) linear and angular momentum are conserved, as is energy. There are no net torques on the system, and the collision is elastic. 

The initial momentum of the ball was
$$
P{tot} =P_{i}=Mv_{0}
$$
The final linear momentum of the system is 
$$
Mv_{f,b}+Mv_{f,s}
$$
Similarly, angular momentum is conserved. Relative to the center of mass of the uniform stick, the ball is a distance $\frac{L}{2}$, so its initial angular momentum is 
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{Mv_{0}l}{2} \\
\text{ and the final momentum is } \\
\frac{Mv_{f}l}{2} + L_{rod}
\end{align}
$$
$L_{rod}=I' \omega$ *DO I NEED SPIN AND ORBITAL?*

c) two counterrotating wheels would cancel out any preference or resistance
