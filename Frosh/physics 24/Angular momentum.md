Angular momentum of a point mass:
$$
L=r^{2}\omega
$$
Angular momentum of extended objects:

$$
L= \left( \sum_{j}m_{j}r^{2}_{j} \right) \omega \equiv I \omega 
$$
The $I$ there is the moment of inertia, aka rotational inertia
$I=\sum_{j}m_{j}r^{2}_{j}$
$=\int dm \, r^{2}$

If we have a simple circle,
$dm=\sigma \,dArea$
$$
\begin{align}
= \frac{M}{\pi R^{2}}2\pi r\, dr \\
I=\int_{0}^{R} r^{2} \, dm  \\
I = \frac{2M}{R^{2}}\left( \frac{r^{4}}{4}|_{0}^{1} \right) \\
I = \frac{MR^{2}}{2}
\end{align}
$$

If instead we have a rod that is uniform and sticking away from a central point that it rotates around, we have
$I=\int r^{2} \, dm$
$$
\begin{align}
\int_{r=0}^{D} r^{2} \frac{M}{D}\, dr\\
= \frac{M}{D} \frac{r^{3}}{3}|_{0}^{D} \\
=\frac{1}{3}MD^{2}
\end{align}
$$
If instead we had a tall door that were rotating, it would have the same moment of inertia as the thin rod. This is because on the distance from the radius and the mass matters, so the extra height has no net contribution.

$\vec{L}=\vec{r}\times \vec{p}$
