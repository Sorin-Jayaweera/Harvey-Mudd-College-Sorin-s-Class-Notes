The wave equation:
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{ \partial^{2} y }{ \partial t^{2} }=V^{2}\frac{ \partial^{2}y }{ \partial x^{2} }  
\end{align}
$$
The acceleration of the disturbance y at the position x at the time t = $v^{2}\times$ the curvature of y at the position x at the time t.

The solutions $y(x,t)$ of this partial differential equation can be any functions of the arguments $(x+Vt) \frac{\text{ and }}{\text{ or }}((x-Vt))$. 
We can check this with the chain rule:

## A special set of solutions: sinusoidal waves
$$
\begin{align}
y(x,t) = A\sin(kx\pm Vt+\phi_{0})
\end{align}
$$
$A$ is the amplitude of the wave
$V$ is the speed of the wave
$\phi_{0}$ is the initial phase of the wave

$k$ is the wavenumber of the wave
	$k=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$ where $\lambda$ is the wavelength
$\omega$ is the angular frequency of the wave
	$\omega=kv=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}V$
	$\omega=\frac{2\pi}{T}$ where $T$ is the period
