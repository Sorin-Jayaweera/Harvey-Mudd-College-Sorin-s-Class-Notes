# sweet spot of rods
A baseball bat can be modeled as a uniform rod of length $d$ and mass $M$. A baseball strikes the bat at distance $y$ from the handle end. 

We call $y$ the 'sweet spot' if, after the ball strikes, the handle end of the bad is instantaneously at rest without the influence of the batter holding onto the handle. 

The end of the bat has translational velocity $V_{cm}\hat{x}$, and moves backwards with speed $\omega  \frac{d}{2}(-\hat{x})$.  To make the handle instantaneously at rest, $V_{cm}\hat{x}+\frac{\omega d}{2}(-\hat{x})=0$, $V_{cm}=\frac{\omega d}{2}$. 

In this system, we want to batter to not exert any force, so linear momentum is conserved. Thus, $\vec{p}_{i}=\vec{p}_{f}$, and $\vec{l}_{A,i}=\vec{l}_{A,f}$ (about reference point $A$). We can set the reference to be on the point that we want to find where the ball hits.

$$
\begin{align}
L_{i}=L_{f} \\
r\times  (mv_{0})+0=r\times  (mv_{f})+(\vec{l}_{orb}+\vec{l_{spin}})_{bat} \\
0+0=0+R_{cm} \times  MV_{cm} +I'\omega
\end{align}
$$
The $R\perp$ is the distance between the center of mass of the bat and the hitting point of the bat. If the center of mass is at $\frac{d}{2}$ and the ball hits at position $y$, the $R\perp$ is $y-\frac{d}{2}$. Thus,

$$
\begin{align}
0=\left( y-\frac{d}{2} \right)MV_{cm}(-\hat{z}) +\frac{1}{12}Md^{2}\omega \hat{z} \\
\left( y-\frac{d}{2} \right)MV_{cm} =\frac{1}{12}Md^{2}\omega  \\
\frac{1}{6}d=y-\frac{d}{2} \\  
y=\frac{2}{3}d
\end{align}
$$
## Gyroscopic precession
$\tau =\frac{dL}{dt}$
$dL=\tau dt$

The wheel without rotating would fall (sideways, its hanging) which means the net torque of gravity is in the $-\hat{z}$. The angular momentum is in the $\hat{x}$ direction.
