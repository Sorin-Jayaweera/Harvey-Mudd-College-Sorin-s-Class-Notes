Torque is the rotational analog of force. 
Angular momentum being conserved requires that net torque $=0$.

$$
\tau = rF\sin\theta_{rF}
$$
with direction $CCW \text{ or } CW$

Torque = the force parallel to the tangent of the circle * radius away

$F_{\perp} = F\sin\theta$
$\vec{\tau}=\vec{r}\times \vec{F}$
$\tau=I \alpha$
$\alpha=\frac{d}{dt}\omega$


We can compute this with determinants. For example, take a radius vector going straight up, and a torque acting along the x axis at a height h/2 along a tree

$\tau_{1}=$
$$
\det \begin{bmatrix}
\hat{x} & \hat{y} & \hat{z} \\
0 & 0 & \frac{h}{2} \\
F_{1} & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$ = $\frac{h}{2}F_{1}\hat{y}$
