In collisions, energy and momentum are conserved.

We represent this with the 4 vector
$$
(E,p_{x},p_{y},p_{z})
$$
In elastic collisions, energy is conserved so we can play out events forward and backwards in time. 

For inelastic collisions, if $F_{net}=0$ then momentum is conserved but not energy (i.e stuff goes to heat).
