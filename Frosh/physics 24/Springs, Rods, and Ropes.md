*It is at this time that i decided to make my notes into a comprehensive textbook, so things before this are incomplete. My apologies to the reader.*
Recall:
Last class we talked about isolation diagrams. 
Choose a coordinate system, making sure it is inertial
write $$
\vec{f}_{net\to i}^{ext} = M_{i}\vec{a}_{i,cm}
$$
Force relationships
$$
\begin{align}
F_{grav} = mg \\
F_{\, r} = k \Delta x
\end{align}
$$
If we assume a string to be massless, we can just do forces on each side.
![[Pasted image 20240130094310.png|300]]
The rope has mass, so the force has to be transmitted along the rope. The rope has to carry itself. The force from the right ship is different from the force on the left ship (?). We can isolate any combination of systems. For instance, if we isolate the ship+rope system ![[Pasted image 20240130094524.png|100]]
We have force $F_{0}$ pulling on the rope.
We have an acceleration to the right. We expect acceleration to have magnitude $\left| a \right|$ and point to the right.
We can say that $F_{net}^{ext} = M_{tot}A_{cm,x}$
$F_{0}=(M+m)a$ which we can easily rewrite a = $\frac{F_{0}}{M+m}$ 
With the system as the combined masses made the acceleration easy to find, so we don't need to worry about the internal contact forces. We still have to solve for the contact force though. 
###### if we choose to isolate the ship
the rope has a a Force on the right of the rope $T_{r} = F_{0}$. The rope also has a tension on the left $T_{l}$ = $T_{c}$ the force on the right of the ship.
We can write that the total force
$T_{r}-T_{l}=F_{tot}=ma$
and $T_{l}=Ma = \frac{MF_{0}}{M+m}$

we can rewrite the expression with
$$
\begin{align}
F_{0}-\left( \frac{M}{m+M} \right)F_{0} = \left( \frac{m}{m+M} \right)F_{0} \\
0=0
\end{align}
$$ so we know that our math checks out.
We can check the units. In the massless rope case, we get tension on the left and right as the same. This fits with our gut check. 

What we just found, though, was that the tension on the left side of the rope is some fraction of the tension on the rope on the right. 

If we have a uniform rope, we can split the rope anywhere and find the tension on the right and left of that point. We can find the tension as a function as how far along the rope we are.

How does this change if we allow the rope to stretch with applied force? what about a spring? 
![[Pasted image 20240130100719.png|300]]
How steep this line is tells us the stiffness of the spring, small slope is easy to push and pull the spring. 
Ropes don't provide any force under compression, but are rigid in tension.

Lets draw a picture to more clearly see what's happening.
![[Pasted image 20240130102344.png|300]]
![[Pasted image 20240130102357.png]]
We can gut check this. If we make k1 really rigid and take $\lim_{ k_{1} \to \infty }$ , ie displacement becomes only $d_{1}$.

![[Pasted image 20240130104820.png|300]]
We can take this exact process for a far more complicated system.
