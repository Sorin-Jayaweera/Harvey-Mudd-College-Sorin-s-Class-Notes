We can decompose benefits into bins:

#use_value:  Benefits from using the good/service, directly or indirectly.
#option_value: Benefits people receive now from having option to use good/service in the future.

#existent_value: Benefits people receive from knowledge of the existence of good/service they never intend to use. Sometimes described as the glow feeling, knowing that a species isn't extinct. 

Willingness to Pay $\neq$ Willingness to accept.
