Efficiency:
1) a socially optimal quantity is the quantity of the good that maximizes total surplus
2) an allocation is #pareto_efficient if there's no way to change things to make at least one person strictly better off, without making at least one person strictly worse off. 

#Neo_classical economics:
Adam smith: "Little else is required to carry a state to the highest degree of opulence from the lowest barbarism, but peace, easy taxes, and a tolerable administration of justice; all the rest being brough about by the natural course of things"
- believes in self correcting markets, aka Laissez-faire!


Requirements to make markets efficient:
- Perfect competition
	- Customers act rationally
- Perfect information
	- make the most efficient decision on how much they want to buy and what they want to buy
	- Lemon law: If you buy an expensive good and it breaks down within a small period of purchasing, than the good is exchanged
- Complete markets
	- minimal transaction costs
	- aka minimal extra effort to get to a product / learn about it
- **No externalities
	- The uncompensated and unintentional costs/benefits imposed on a third party
	- The uncompensated impact of one person's unintentional actions on the well-being of a bystander.
- **No public goods**
