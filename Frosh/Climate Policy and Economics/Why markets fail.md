## Recall:

#notation: * is social optimum, m is private market quantity

L is deadweight loss with externalities
- If we are producing at private market quantity, the marginal cost is greater than the demand
- Producing greater than Q* has social marginal cost greater than marginal benefit
D and G together make the increase in surplus when producers and consumers can consume more, but has more deadweight cost. The change in total damage with externality 

K = L+D+G = is the change in total damage when increasing production from Q* to $Q_{m}$

## Why do markets fail?
### Public goods
Externalities and public goods are directly connected. If we leave a market to itself, private markets can't ensure that goods are made available for the maximum benefit of society as a whole. IE vaccines.

This is particularly true for goods without prices or clear property rights.
- We don't pay for clean air, or beautiful scenery of Malibu
Goods have main characteristics, ie:
- #excludability: a person can be prevented from using it
- #rivalry:one person's use diminishes other people's use
* #private_goods: excludable, rival in consumption
	* Anything from a grocery store or market
* #public_goods:not rival, not excludable
	* 
* #open_access_resources:Rival, but not excludable
	* #common_resources: rival but not excludable, same as open access resources
	* Fresh water
	* Parking lot
* #club_goods: excludable but not rival
	* streaming music that you have to pay to access

  EX: only a few people pay for Wikipedia, but everyone uses it. B is paying for Wikipedia, but A is using it.
B is providing the public good for everyone.

Socially optimal is the intersection between aggregate demand and aggregate cost, but private market production is the intersection QB and cost. **This means that public goods are underprovided**.

A private provision of public goods is a positive externality, which allows for freeloaders to take advantage of others instead of being willing to pay and increase production.
### Open access resources

#tragedy_of_the_commons
TRAGEDY OF THE COMMONS
Each individual feels/internalizes diminished return (per unit of the resource) to himself, but **diminished return imposed on others is $External$ and therefore ignored.**
