## What is economist's interpretation of "values"?
There are two main types of values, #market_values (quantifiable numbers for goods that are sold, benefit, what the market actually is) and #non-market_values (intangible but possible to estimate). We typically focus on #quantifiable_values ,because for unquantifiable the data isn't available or the questions aren't fully defined.
