## Analysis and design when measuring effect of policy
Recall that last time we found that one must consider the "leakage" effect of policies, what are potential unintended consequences. What are ways that we can combat this?

In the trash bag example from last time, we could imagine modifying the policy; instead of just taxing plastic bags from stores, we could tax all plastic products. 

Dirty factories aren't able to keep up with regulations in California, so production moves to less strictly regulated areas. This is pollution leakage. This is why every nation across the world needs to take action. Carbon emission is a #public_bad as opposed to a public good. 

In economics, we need to create a #counterfactual. For any study, we need to have a control group at the same time to see the real effect of a policy while accounting for everything else. It is impossible to perfectly have this counterfactual. In economics, we have $\mathrm{\text{ Difference in Differences }}$.

We have to find the difference between before and after. Specific areas have #selection_bias,where the type of people who wouldn't want to smoke cigarettes live in the place that would implement cigarette tax. We have to subtract the two lines. The change from D to E is the actual benefit from the treatment. $C-A$ controls for the time trend, $D-B$ has both time trend and treatment effect Hence, $D-B-(C-A)$ gives us the real effect of the treatment.

## Private solutions to market failure

#behavioral_economics : economists and psychologists work together to give people "nudges" to manipulate their behavior/understand how public things change. 
#default is a very common nudge. For instance, organ donors. It used to be default to not be an organ doner, and have to check a mark. It was changed to be default as an organ doner with a check to not be. This caused organ donations to rise by $\approx 30$%

Others are Boycotting/Lobbying, grocers wanting to transition to green products for the image, etc.
## The problem of social cost
Coase's theorem relies on a few assumptions.

The total settlement was $20 Million dollars. The residents only got about $\frac{2}{3}$ of the payout. Everyone got cancer or died, and they had to sign an NDA and a form promising to not sue the company for health reasons. 

Pareto efficiency says nothing about #equity, being fair and equal for society. 
Just because we have an efficient outcome, we don't have an equitable outcome. This comes to the limitations of Coase Theorem and Coasian bargaining.

The hurdles include:
1) difficult to establish causation
2) the collective action problem (free-riding and bargining within/accross groups)
3) Imperfect *sorry I wasn't fast enough to get all 5*

How to privately solve the tragedy of the commons?
- Hardin believes that we need to institute more taxes and other coercive devices to escape the horror of the commons. Common property should be completely privatized or regulated by central authorities.
- What if we let the group of farmers get together and find the solution themselves?
- Ostrom believes that, although tragedies have definitely occurred, for thousands of years people have self organized to manage common-pool resources. This means we wouldn't have to step in.
