*It is at this time that i decided to make my notes into a comprehensive textbook, so things before this are incomplete. My apologies to the reader.*

Recall:
	Market Failures
	- Public goods
	- Open access resources
	The under provision problems arise from people ignoring negative externalities when using oar, leading to them over exploiting the resource. IE: a free pasture for cows to graze at, carrying capacity 4 cows. There are 4 farmers each with their own many cows. They all want to graze their cows their, and end up overgrazing.
	also, recall the definition of Excludability and Rivalry.
	#excludability:a person can be prevented from using it, the degree to which a good, service, or resource can be limited to only paying consumers (Paul Samuelson, 1954)
	#rivalry: one person's use diminishes other people's use, the consumption by one consumer prevents simultaneous consumption by other consumers. 

## Public policies addressing market failures
In a market failure, goods are categorized based on their excludability and rivalry. 
Private markets do not necessarily lead to efficient outcomes.
Externality distorts the market, leading to sub-optimal allocation of resources.
Some property right regimes (or lack thereof) can create perverse incentives that lead to **resource over-exploitation** and **under-provision of public goods**.
Some market policies can be implemented to address these issues.  

### Market policies:
Quota:
- Fisheries/over fishing, fishery management regulations. Governments can set a quota for the fishery. 
- carbon emissions permits are paid for by volume, with a limited emission cap in an area. 
- Permits/quota/cap are the same thing.
* EPA requires producers to publish amount of pollutants, giving information about the market.

Pigouvian taxes and subsidies ("emission charges", "emission fees). Effects Price
Tradable pollution allowances/permits/quotas ("cap and trade system"). Effects Quantity
Both policies give the exact same outcome, assuming that all people are being logical and buying at the maximum. 

Question: does gasoline tax lead to deadweight cost?
	  ![[Pasted image 20240130140743.png|300]]
	corrective tax gets rid of deadweight loss. (called #pigouvian_tax)
#pigouvian_tax: Corrective, align private incentives with society's interests, make private parties take into account external costs and benefits. 
#distortive_tax: a tax that isn't to account for negative externalities.

#cap_and_trade: a market based policy that
1) sets a quantity limit(cap) on total pollution in an industry
2) issues allowances
3) allows for entities to trade those allowances in a market. 
California sells allowances by letting companies bid on them. 
### Non market policies:
Command and control policies:
* government says that a company isn't allowed / is required to do an action 
* technology standard: requirements that firms adopt a particular technology to reduce emissions. IE: scrubbers to prevent $SO_{2}$ emissions from factories. 
## Unintended consequences of public policies
Based on research, the plastic bag tax for supermarkets has been effective. However, the tax isn't enough to fully shift the curve over. The tax on the grocery store plastic bags but not on trash bags shifted behaviors of consumers. Instead of using grocery bags for trash, people transitioned to buying trash bags. The elimination of 40 million pounds of plastic carryout bags is offset by a 12-million-pound increase in trash bag purchases
