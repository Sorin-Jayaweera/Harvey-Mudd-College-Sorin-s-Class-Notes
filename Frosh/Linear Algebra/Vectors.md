#Vector: a vector is a directed line segment that represents displacement. It has a magnitude and a length. We call vectors with n real vale components vectors in $R^n$. This is written as $\vec{v} \in R^n$ 

Vector addition and subtraction happens component-wise as typical, so

$$
\begin{align} 
\begin{pmatrix}
u \\
v
\end{pmatrix} 
+ \begin{pmatrix}
n \\
m
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
n + n \\
v + m
\end{pmatrix}
 \\ 
\begin{pmatrix}
4 \\
2
\end{pmatrix}
\times
2 = 
\begin{pmatrix}
8 \\
4
\end{pmatrix} \\

\end{align}
$$
Two vectors are equal if their components are equal $\implies$ direction and magnitude are equal, but this is hard to think about $\in R^{100}$

#Proofs: there are four main proof strategies.
1) Direct Proof
2) Proof by contraposition
3) proof by contradiction
4) proof by induction
