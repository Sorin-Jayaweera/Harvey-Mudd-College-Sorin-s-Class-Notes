Determine whether $V$ and $W$ are isomorphic, where $V = \{A \in M_{22} : \text{tr}(A) = 0\}$ and $W = \mathbb{R}^2$. If they are, give an explicit isomorphism $T: V \to W$.

For $V$ and $W$ to be isomorphic, they have to be one to one and onto. For this to be true, $V$ and $W$ must have the same dimension. 
$V$ can be described as the set of matrices
$$
\left\{ \begin{bmatrix}
a & b \\
c & -a
\end{bmatrix}\forall a,b,c \in Re \right\}
$$
Because there are three variables, we can express V in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ by $\begin{bmatrix}a \\ b \\ c\end{bmatrix}$. We see that dim(V) = 3. On the other hand, dim(W) is 2, as it is in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$.  

Two finite vector spaces are isomorphic if and only if their dimensions are the same, therefore $V$ and $W$ are not isomorphic.
