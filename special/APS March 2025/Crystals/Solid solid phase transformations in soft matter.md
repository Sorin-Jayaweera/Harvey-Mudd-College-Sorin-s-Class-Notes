Useful for manufacturing?

Changing between preference of different solid phases for microstructures. 

control aggregation and assembly using optical and acoustic traps to assemble molecules

We take a lot of close packed structures (body centered cubic, face centered, etc) and observe behaviors during simulation

Metastability

Kinetics govern the types of transformation between phases (i.e. FCC and A15 phase)

Stable polymorph formation.
