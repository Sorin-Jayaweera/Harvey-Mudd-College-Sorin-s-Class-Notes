Structure dictates function. Structure enhances optical properties of a material, i.e. the optical response. We can see the different packing structures of the particles in a well with depth that influences optical functions. 

Isotropic pair potentials form complex bulk structures.


How does structure emerge in these multi length scale systems?

Use molecular dynamics with linear time ramp to simulate particles. 

Close packing at small system size
Lenard Jones system?
