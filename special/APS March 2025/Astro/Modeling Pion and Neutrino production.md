not the actual name, but smth like that. 

Measuring low energy neutrino cross sections

Coherent elastic neutrino nucleus scattering

Background:
use a proton accelerator to get protons onto liquid mercury, which makes neutrons and neutrinos.

Instead of liquid mercury, what about tantalum strips on tungsten rotating?

The project - simulation
The goal is to observe pion and neutrino production from a simplified geometry. 

Geant4 to as simulation tool.

More Tantalum strips $\implies$ smaller spacing between discrete points. 

Conclusion:
observed jumps in proton energy at pion creation at the locations of tantalum strips.
