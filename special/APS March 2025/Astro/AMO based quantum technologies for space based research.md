Modern research methods in atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics laboratories allow access to quantum mechanical phenomena.
Recent advancements:
* [ ]  Low temperatures: confirmed quantum behavior down to nano kelvin (coldest temperature in the universe)
* [ ] Coherence times are getting longer for non atomic clock things
* [ ] Trap strontium particles in optical tweezers have minute long coherence even at high energy transitions. 
* [ ] Quantum computers need to handle more than single particle coherence, but larger systems. 
* [ ] We have gotten better at manipulating and moving single atoms and have easily programmable entanglement.

Space is a great laboratory, always freefall with no noise, we can do atomic physics. 


Differential acceleration: shoot a laser between two space based atom interferometers, and use the light pulses as a ruler to measure their relative motion to see gravity waves.
