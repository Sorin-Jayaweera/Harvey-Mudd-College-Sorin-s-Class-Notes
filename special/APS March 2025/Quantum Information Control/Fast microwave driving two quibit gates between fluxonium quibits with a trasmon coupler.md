Binary encodings with energy levels, where the transitions are between fluxonium couplers.

When you excite the coupler and the fluxonium is binary, you get 4 excited states. If you excite the coupler to zero to 1 based on the state of the fluxonium. The frequency(?) corresponding to that is t...


difference between frequencies between the coupler and fluxoniums.

Conditional spectroscopy of the coupler.

They use resonators to read out the state of the coupler and drive the fluxonium to cause a change in state. What is the coupler 

decreasing gate time increases error, lowering fidelity. 

Drive frequency correlates to output states, so short time for a signal means more uncertainty in the frequency of that signal, which increases amplitude in unwanted states. You can suppress that frequency component by 

FAST-DRAG: define a frequency window where you want to suppress the frequency component, and build a Fourier ansatz based off of how many Fourier components you want to add to the ansatz. This improves fidelity for short gate times, and for long times we maintain high fidelity. 

We eliminate multiple components of our state transition frequency. 

Summary:
They showed low ZZ, and use simple pulse shaping techniques to get high fidelity gates.
