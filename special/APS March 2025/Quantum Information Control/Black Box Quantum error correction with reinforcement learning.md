## Quantum feedback for state preparation

We have a state, action on an environment, and a reward that influences state. This is a neural network

PPO algorithm
$$
\begin{align}
a_{t} \sim  \pi_{\theta} (A | s_{t} ) \\  
\end{align}
$$

We are measuring a quantum system in a noisy environment

## Discovering quantum error correcting circuits


A stabilizer code is defined by an Abelian subgroup of the Pauli group that has conditions on if an error is correctable.
