When you try to fix a gate and make it robust, you have tradeoffs in global quantities. But there isn't a fundamental tradeoff.

Space curve quantum control
$$
\begin{align}
\vec{r}(t)\cdot \sigma = \int_{0}^{t} dt' U_{0} ^{\dagger} \sigma_{z} U_{0} 
\end{align}
$$
Dephrasing robust controls yield loops in 3D/.

Time in quantum evoltuion...

From curves to hamiltonians: Apply field conditions that have curvature "bend" and torsion, "twist". We usually think of gates as

$$
\begin{align}
\ket{\psi(t)} = U_{0}(t) \ket{\psi(0)}  
\end{align}
$$
As a quantum channel.
$$
\begin{align}
U_{0}(T_{g} )=U_{g} \to   R_{U_{0} } (T_{g} ) \dots 
\end{align}
$$
We have a notion of locality that arises.
Purely local gate fixing 
Dephrasing robust controls -> Loops in 3D.
Add pulse constraints, robustness conditions. The more you ask the more loops to choose from, 
Bezier Anzants for Robust Control. Encode pulse robustness with the control points of a bezier curve. 

We encode information in a curve.
