The cohomology of a cochain complex $(C;d)$ in the ith degree is $H'(C;d)=ker\left( \frac{d^{i}}{Imd ^{i-1}} \right)$

First, one often sees singular or simplician homology, cellular homology.

For a $\underbrace{ CW complex }_{ X'' },$ $\chi(x)=\sum(-1)^{i}(\text{\# i-dim cells })$
For a finite graph $G=(V,E),\chi(G)=\stackrel{\text{ \# verticies -}}{\text{ \# edges }}$

For a finite graph $G,\chi(G)=\sum_{i=0}^{i}(-1^{i}{\text{ \# i-1 cells }})$

We are gluing together multiple differeng graphs of different dimensions.
EG. of a cellular decomposition 

We have a two disc where $S_{2}$ is a point in the south pole with the boundary of a twoball to that point.
The two ball is an open two disk.
$$
\begin{align}
S^{2}=\{pt\} \sqcup B^{2} \text{ via } \\
\sigma B^{2} \rightarrow   \{pt\}
\end{align}
$$
These is called a shubert cell.

$S^{2}$ is called a homeomorphism, $S^{2}$ carries a complex structure. If we add that in with a steriographic projection, we see that $S^{2}\simeq \mathbf{P'}_{c}$
$$
\begin{align}
\mathbb{R_{c}'} = \mathbb{C}^{2} \frac{\{(0,0)\}}{\mathbb{C}^{*}} \\
\end{align}
$$
"line through the origin".

We call a member of an equivalence class a "representative", which we represent by homogeneous coordinates . For this equivalence relation, we write this as $[Z_{0},Z_{1}]$. In c2, we say $z=[z_{1},z_{2}]\in \mathbb{C}_{2}$
Through the equivalence relation, $z~w \text{ if } \exists \lambda \in \mathbb{C}^{*}$ such that $\lambda z=W$.

Here, $\lambda z=\lambda(z_{1},z_{2}) = (\lambda z_{0},\lambda z_{1})$. Note: $z_{0}\text{ and } z$ are not both O.

Let $$
\begin{align}
\mathbf{T}=\mathbb{C}^{*}\rightarrow  \mathbb{P}' \text{ via } \lambda\cdot [z_{0},z_{1}]=[\lambda z_{0},\lambda^{2}z_{1}] \\
\rightarrow  [z_{0}:\lambda'z_{1}].
\end{align}
$$
Question:
What are the torus fixed points of this action?
The answer: There are not so many, after this well want to ask what flows to these fixed points. We have $A$ to $(i)i$ $T$ with fixed points. pt 1 = $[1:0]$, pt2 = $[0:1]$. For simplicity, lets call pt1 $S$ and pt 2 $N$.
