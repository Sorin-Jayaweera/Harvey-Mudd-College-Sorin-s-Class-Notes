External electric fields points from positive to negative
Internal electric fields point south to north
- Form loops

For a wire w/ current: 

Magnetic field is produce by [[Current]] (moving [[Charge|charges]])
magnetic field lines form loops around the wire

Magnetic field exerts [[Magnetic Force|force]] on moving changes
