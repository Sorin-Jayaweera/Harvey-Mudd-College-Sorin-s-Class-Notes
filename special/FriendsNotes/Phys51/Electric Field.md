$\vec{E}$ is the force per unit [[Charge]].
$$
\vec{E}=\frac{\vec{F}_{\text{on } q_{0}}}{q_{0}}
$$
($\vec{F}=q\vec{E}$)
Electric fields point away from positive charges and towards negative charges.

([[Vector Field]])

#### Point Masses

$$
\vec{E}= \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{q}{r^{2} }\hat{r}
$$
(Commonly referred to as [[Coulomb's Law]])
[[Superposition]] also applies: $\vec{E}=\vec{E}_{1}+\vec{E}_{2}+\cdots$

$p=qd$: dipole moment


#### How to Draw Electric Field Lines
- EFLs point parallel to the direction of the force felt by a positive test charge
- EFLs start/end on positive/negative charges, or at infinity
- EFLs never intersect
- Density of lines indicates strength of electric field
- Near a point or line charge, EFLs points radially outwards/inwards
- Near a charges surface, EFLs point perpendicular to the surface
- Symmetry of charges is reflected in the symmetry of the field
- We only draw EFLs in the plane of the page â€“ can draw multiple perspectives if necessary.


#### Non-point Masses
**Discrete:**
$$
\vec{E}=\sum_{i} \frac{q_{i}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r_{i}^{2} }\hat{r}_{i}
$$
$\hat{r}_{i}$: points from $q_{i}$ to the *field point* of interest.

**Continuous:**
$$
\vec{E}=\int d\vec{E}
$$
$d\vec{E}$: the infinitesimal $\vec{E}$ field of the field point caused by $dq$.

$$
\vec{E}=\underbrace{ \int \frac{\rho dV}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r^{2} }\hat{r} }_{ \text{3D} } = \underbrace{ \int \frac{\sigma dA}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r^{2} }\hat{r} }_{ \text{2D} } = \underbrace{ \int \frac{\lambda ds}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r^{2} }\hat{r} }_{ \text{1D} }
