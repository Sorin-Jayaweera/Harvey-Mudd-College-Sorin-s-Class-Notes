## Value Investing
Investing in companies that are undervalued by the market (trading for less than their intrinsic value).

#### Common Stock

#### Stock Price

#### Annual/Quarterly Reports

#### Market Capitalization

#### Enterprise Value

#### Price/Earnings Ratio

#### Net Income Margin

#### Dividend Yield



## Investment Criteria
In order of importance

### 1. Return on Enterprise Value
ROI assuming 100% ownership

$$
\text{Return on Enterprise Value} =\frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Enterprise Value}}= \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Market Cap + Debt + Minority Interest/Preferred Shares - Cash/Cash Equivalents}} 
$$
### 2. Net Profit Margin
Revenue left after all expenses incurred to generate revenue (incl. misc. income/expenses, after interest and tax).
### 3. Revenue Growth



### Rule of 72:
Used to determine how long it will take for an investment to double, given a fixed rate of return

Divide annual rate of return into 72:
- 6%:
	72/6 = 12 years to double
	24 years to quadruple
- 8%
	72/8 = 9 years to double
	18 years to quadruple
etc.

**Mutual Funds:**
1% management fee over 40 years $\approx$ 2/3 of what could be made if no fee




#### List of Hagan Stocks:
**PE (Price/EPS):**
- Hagan 106: 14.4 (1/14.4 $\implies$ $\approx$ 6.9% return)
- S&P 500: 38.5 (1/38.5 $\implies$ $\approx$ 2.6% return)
Lower PE $\implies$ higher return


**Revenue 2 Yr CAGR:**
- Hagan 106: 3.6% (6.9%+3.6% = 10.5%)
- S&P 500: 6.9% (2.6%+6.9% = 9.7%)
Value stock gives higher, but also will perform better during a downturn/recession.

**Net Debt/EBITDA:**
- Hagan 106: 1.5 ($\approx$ yrs to pay off debt)
- S&P 500: 2.2
