### Definition:
The [[Electrons]] in a ***dielectric*** are <u>bound</u> to their molecules, and not free to roam as in a [[Conductor|metal]].

**Polar Dielectrics:**
Some molecules have a permanent dipole moment, and the applied [[special/FriendsNotes/Phys51/Electric Field]] acts to align them.

**Non-polar Dielectrics:**
Other materials have no dipole moment until an [[special/FriendsNotes/Phys51/Electric Field]] is applied, displacing the electrons slightly from their normal position.

**Linear Dielectric Materials:**
For many common materials, the [[magnitude]] of the induced opposing field is linearly proportional to the applied field. For such materials we can define a **dielectric constant**:
$$
\kappa_{E}=\frac{E_{0}}{E} = \frac{E_{0}}{E_{0}-E_{ind}}
$$
$$
\implies E_{ind}=E_{0}\left( 1-\frac{1}{\kappa_{E}} \right) 
$$
$E=E_{0}-E_{ind}$ : the net/resulting field inside
