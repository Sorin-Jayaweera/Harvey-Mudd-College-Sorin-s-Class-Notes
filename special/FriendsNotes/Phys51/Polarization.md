## Polarization 
 > [!note]+ Definition 
 > ***Polarization*** is the direction of oscillating [[special/FriendsNotes/Phys51/Electric Field]] in an [[Electromagnetic Wave]].
 > 
###### Ex: 
Light travelling in the $\hat{x}$ direction can be $y$-polarized, $z$-polarized, or any angle in between.

*Unpolarized* light contains waves with multiple E-field oscillation directions.



#### Linear Polarizers
Absorb (or deflect) one polarization, and transmit the orthogonal polarization.

If the axis of a linear polarizer is oriented at an angle $\theta$ to the polarization of incoming light:

$$
\lvert E_{out} \rvert = \lvert E_{in}\rvert \cos\theta
$$
##### Law of Malus
Transmission through at linear polarizer at an angle $\theta$ drops the [[Poynting Vector#Intensity|intensity]] by
$$
I_{out} = I_{in}\cos^{2}\theta .
$$



#### Optical Anisotropy
##### Birefringence
If unpolarized light enters a birefringent material (one that has direction-dependent [[Dielectric]] properties, ex. calcite), then there are two different [[Electromagnetic Wave#Reflection and Transmission at an Interface|indices of refraction]] (i.e. $n_{\parallel} > n_{\perp}$), then there are two different speeds of light. These two resulting light rays bend at different angles and have a relative phase shift of
$$
\Delta\phi = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}(n_{0}-n_{e})d
$$


### Circular Polarizers
Waves with a quarter-phase (45$^{\circ}$) offset propagating in the same direction yield an interference pattern that has a circular rotation.

$$
\vec{E} = E_{0}\cos(kx-\omega t)\hat{y} + E_{0}\sin(kx-\omega t)\hat{z}
$$
