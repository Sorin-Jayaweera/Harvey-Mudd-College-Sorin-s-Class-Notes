When should we include G in our free body diagrams?
This depends on what type of equilibrium we reach, and what deformation or changes we are looking for. For example, a mass on a spring with gravity pulling down will have a static equilibrium with gravity acting, and will deform away from that equilibrium with an input force. On the other hand, if there is someone skydiving then there is no constant position, only constant velocity (terminal v). Similarly, there is no  static equilibrium for the submarine, as gravity is not unique and the entire apparatus + system around it can change or be at rest.

When considering a system with multiple input forces, we have to set up the system and add forces as usual. We first express all the restoring forces and input forces, sum them, rewrite to have input on one side and output on the other, then find $\omega$ and other key values.


## Rotation models
We have torsional springs and torsional dampers.
We can use the right hand rule to determine the direction an arrow for torque should point. Other than that, springs and dampers rotationally act the same as linearly.


## Rotational mechanical systems


## Linear Time invariant equations
a governing is linear iff $x$ and its derivatives are raised to the first power only, and $x$ and its derivatives are not multiplied by other functions of x.

The governing equation is time invariant if the coefficients attached to those terms are constant, i.e not varying with time.

In LTI systems, scaling and superposition hold. If the input is doubled, so is the output. 
The response of three inputs is the same as the response to each individual input.
