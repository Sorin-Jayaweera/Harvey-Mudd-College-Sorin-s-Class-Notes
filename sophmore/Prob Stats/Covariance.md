Covariance is a measure of the joint variability of two random variables. For random variables $X$ and $Y$ with expected values $\mu_{x} \text{ and } \mu_{y}$, respectively, the covariance is 
$$
\begin{align}
cov(X,Y) & =E\left[ (x-\mu_{x})(y-\mu_{y}) \right]  \\
 & = E(xy)-\mu_{x}\mu_{y}
\end{align}
$$

cov(X,Y)=cov(Y,X)
cov(X,X)=var(X).

If covariance is positive, there is a positive correlation between $x$ and $y$. Negative means negative association, i.e. increasing one decreases the other. If they are completely independent, covariance is zero.
