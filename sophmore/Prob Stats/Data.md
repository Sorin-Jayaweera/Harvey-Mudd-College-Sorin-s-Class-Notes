A data frame is a common convenient way to organize data. Data frames organize data into a two-dimensional table of rows and columns. 
Each row is a case, or observational unit.
Each column is a variable.

Variables can be classified as numerical or categorical. 

Numerical variable: takes values that are numbers. Can be continuous or discrete.
Categorical variables: all the possible values are called "levels". Can be nominal, where levels have no natural ordering - i.e. red green blue - or ordinal, where there is natural ordering.
