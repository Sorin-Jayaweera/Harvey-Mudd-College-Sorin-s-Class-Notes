We also need a particle description of light. There are three main experiments that go against the classical wave like behavior of electromagnetism.

These are the Photo-electric effect, Compton scattering, and single-photon anticoincidence. 

### Photo-electric effect
In classical optics,
$$
\begin{align}
I=\left< S_{p} \right> = \frac{E_{0}^{2}}{2\mu_{0}c}n 
\end{align}
$$
In Quantum Optics,
$$
\begin{align}
E_{\gamma} & =h\nu, \\ I  & = \frac{\text{ power }}{\text{ area }} \\
 & =\frac{N(h \nu)}{\text{ time * area }} \\
 \\
 \text{ where } h & =6.626*10^{-34}Js \\
 & =4.14*1-^{-15}eVs,  \\
\text{ and }  n  & = \text{ number of photons }, \nu=\text{ frequency }
\end{align}
$$

If we attach two metal plates with wires between them, we can drive a current by knocking off electrons with light shining on it.

To know the work done, we can put in a battery that is driving current in the other direction, and find at what voltage the current in the circuit becomes zero. 

### Compton Scattering


If we have an x ray entering a sheet of graphite and knocking off electrons, classical optics says that everywhere we should see a wave of the same frequency as the x raw. However, we see that the frequency is dependent on the angle off of the block.
We can model this as a light wave hitting an electron, and perform momentum conservation. Recall that
$$
\begin{align}
E^{2}=p^{2}c^{2}+m^{2}c^{4}
\end{align}
$$
Drawing out the wave scattering in a direction and the electron in another, we can make 3 equations, each in terms of $\lambda', \theta, \phi,\text{ and } p_{e}$. Using the three equations, we can get a single equation in terms of just $\lambda'=f(\theta)$, and check with the experimental result. 

We get:
$$
\begin{align}
\lambda'-\lambda=\frac{h}{m_{e}c}(1-\cos_{\theta})
\end{align}
$$

Remember the trig identity: $$
\begin{align}
\frac{\left( 1-\cos\theta \right)}{2}=\sin ^{2}\left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) 
\end{align}
$$
So we can rewrite this as the wavelength shift
$$
\begin{align}
\lambda'-\lambda=\frac{2h}{m_{e}c}\sin ^{2}\left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)
\end{align}
$$
