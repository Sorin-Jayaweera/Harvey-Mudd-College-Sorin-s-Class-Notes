Recall the integral form of Gauss's law:
$$
\begin{align} 
 âˆ¯\vec{E}\cdot \vec{dA} = \frac{q}{\epsilon_{0}}
\end{align}
$$

We relate the divergence (how much electric field "sprays out" from a point) to the charge density at that point. 

$$
\begin{align}
\underbrace{ \vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{E} }_{\text{ divergence of E at a specific point }  } =\underbrace{ \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_{0}} }_{ \frac{charge}{volume}\text{ at that point } }
\end{align}
$$

Lets also recall how divergence works.
$$
\begin{align}
\vec{C}(x,y,z)=C_{x}(x,y,z)+C_{y}(x,y,z)+C_{z}(x,y,z) \\
\vec{\nabla}\cdot \vec{c} = \frac{d}{dx} C_{x}+\frac{d}{dx} C_{y}+\frac{d}{dx} C_{z}
\end{align}
$$
We can write a similar expression for different coordinate systems.

Where there is a positive charge, there is a positive divergence. A negative charge has a negative divergence.

Recall a solid sphere of unform charge has the unique electric field behavior

$$
\begin{align}
\iiint (\vec{\Delta} \cdot \vec{E}) dv = \iiint\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_{0}} dv
\end{align}


$$
The volume enclosed by any surface   |   same volume as the left hand side 

Because this holds for any limits of any surface enclosing a volume, the integrands are equal.
Therefore,
$$
\begin{align}
\Delta\cdot \vec{E}=\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_{0}}
\end{align}
$$
