A magnetic field is generated by current (moving charges).

We have an equivalent formula to coulombs law for magnetics, called the Biot-Savart Law.
$$
\begin{align}
d\vec{B}=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi} \frac{id\vec{l}\times  \hat{r}}{r^{2}}
\end{align}
$$
We have $id\vec{l}$ as thee source of the field,$\times \hat{r}$ is the direction. similar to $dq \hat{r}$ for the electric field. 
$\frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi}=1*10^{-7}$
$\mu_{0}$ is called the permeability of free space (as opposed to the permittivity of free space $\epsilon_{0}$). $\mu_{0}$=$4\pi*10^{-7} \left[ \frac{TM}{A} \right]$.

Lets try an example. What is the magnet field at a point r away from an infinite, straight, current carrying wire.

We can ask again, a circular ring of current with a point above the center of the ring.

Woah! This looks interesting. The fundamental current distribution that causes a magnetic field (a magnetic dipole) is a circular ring of current! The magnetic field points up independent of the height $Z$, even if it is negative.
