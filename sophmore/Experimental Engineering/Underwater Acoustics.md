$$
\begin{align} 
Re=\frac{\rho u d}{\mu} 
\end{align}
$$
Where $\rho$ is the fluid density, $u$ is the flow speed, $d$ is the characteristic length, and $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of water.

$$
\begin{align}
C_{d} = \frac{\mathbb{D}}{0.5 \rho \nu^{2} A_{\text{ frontal }} }  \\
C_{l}  = \frac{\mathbb{L}}{0.5 \rho \nu^{2}A_{\text{ platform }} }
\end{align}
