The notion of language in French cultural theory with Lacan, the notion of the symbolic order, Foucauet and Bourdieu on the notions of discourse.

The central subject for them is the ability to express oneself and communicate with others. This is described as subjectification, where language does not belong to you but instead to a group that preexists you, that you have to learn and use to communicate. 

Bakhtin's dialogism is very similar to this theory of language and social organization.

We should clarify what we mean by subjects. Subject in latin is whoever is sub/under. "Ject" is to throw, move. A subject is someone who has been thrown under language, and having to work under that languages expectations. Similarly in dialogue, you are thrown under the force of the dialog that you enter. 

To communicate with a world is predicated on entering a language that is not ours. 

-- Now on to the book --

Mushkin gets interpreted under many different manners by the people around him, and now is forced to perform in that way.

He is seen as a forger, as someone who is looking for an eligible wife, etc. The agency and intentions of people are moderated by the earlier text and earlier situations that they see themselves in.

### Questions and discussion: 
#### We should consider carefully the symmetry that we see between characters: 
The prince, Ippolot, and Burdovsky are all sick. Dostoevsky loves to juxtapose characters that are similar in some ways and different in others.


#### What's with Aglia, the poem, and her reaction to the Prince and Ganya
class response: She seperates herself from people when she sees that she isn't the only person that they are interested in. 
Also, what is the point of her recitation of Don Quixote? The poem celebrates a poor knight, someone who is engaged in serving the Madonna. The Madonna is Nastasya Fillipovna, the poor knight is the prince. Agalia could be mad at the prince for sending her a romantic note but then chasing Nastasya. She is drawing attention to his weird obsession with Nastasya, saying that it is unreasonable etc. Almost in petty vengeance...


#### What is NFP's objective/scheme with shouting about IOU's
Is she trying to get rid of Yevgeny as a suitor for Aglaia to leave the prince as the only person left for her, i.e. trying to care for the prince? Is she seeking social disorder, destructiveness? Is she colluding with the prince to steal money from Aglia?
