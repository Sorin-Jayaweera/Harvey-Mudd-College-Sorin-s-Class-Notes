>[!abstract]+ Definition: Realism
>is a system of cultural conventions
>The real and the human experience is knowable to the developing hard and natural sciences, not to the abstract reason.


>[!abstract]+ Definition: Textuality
>For us: How texts make meaning, and how texts are organized. Text is the physical books as we know them, but that is a material carrier of a lot of linguistic signs. For Anna Karenina, we have multiple sequences of translations etc. The true "text" is what did the author mean to say. We find it from the cultural period where the author may have been, as well as insights from other texts by the author. 
>
>For others: Studies all of the additions of the text. All the drafts, versions, editions, and what is the authoritative text.


>[!abstract]+ Definition: Overdetermination
>Meaning manifests itself by repeating the same symbols, the same words over and over again. It is overdetermined. Communication is possible only when it is redundant, language must be redundant. If we don't track this, we are analyzing our own individual idiosyncrasies, we have to interpret based off of a consistent pattern repeating throughout the text.
>For others: Conscious experiences are seen as potentially influenced by an unlimited number of experiences a human being has had, including events that cannot be remembered.
>


>[!abstract]+ Definition: Psychoanalysis
>Our present is shaped by our past, and can be categorized and understood as a general classification.

>[!abstract]+ Definition: Dialogism/Polyphony, Bakhtin
>A person entering the world always enters in the middle of someone else speaking, there are thousands of years of various statements and acts. All of those statements uttered are responding to past acts. Polyphony describes how consciousness/experience begins when a person enters the dialogic conversation in the middle.

>[!abstract]+ Definition: The Real, the Imaginary, The Symbolic, Lacan:
>The real is impossible, the imaginary is the mirror stage. We use the available language to explain what we are to other people 

>[!abstract]+ Definition: Mirror Stage and Identification, Lacan
>The way in which human subjects identify or misidentify themselves as individual or distinct from others. The process by which human subjects compare themselves to visual models of what a person is. 


>[!abstract]+ Definition: Desire, Lacan
> The object of desire is (happiness, self sacrifice, social justice, spiritual purity) etc. The objective of desire is to continue desire, to self reproduce. The real is impossible, we can't figure out what a person experiences. The imaginary and symbolic provide too many opportunities for identification and misidentification. People are always trying to satisfy the real, so we are caught in the endless attempts to keep, reidentify, or explain more precisely. 

>[!abstract]+ Definition: Mediated Desire, Girard

>[!abstract]+ Definition: Interpellation, Althusser
>When a character identifies someone else as a figure, subsuming their character into a model of self understanding. They impose a set of rules within which they must negotiate.
>

>[!abstract]+ Definition: Subjectification, Foucault, Lacan
>Entry into language. A process of an individual entering language and becoming a human subject, giving the means to explain what that biological is and allowing them to communicate with other biological blobs. 
>Subject = thrown under the power of language

>[!abstract]+ Definition: Discipline, Foucault
>The process whereby the functioning of physical power/ threat historically is replaced by psychological self discipline. Belief in the work ethic. Psychological self organization.

>[!abstract]+ Definition: Hedonic/Utilitarian Calculus, Bentham, Mill
> The process by which we judge and evaluate the way of maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain. 

>[!abstract]+ Definition: The Will and Representation, Schoppenhauer
> Will is nature wanting to reproduce itself, using any elements to do that. Our lives are not our own, we exist only for nature to reproduce further. This is the real that is impossible.
