This quiz is open note, so I referenced my notes from the class while writing the definitions for each term.

Example of textuality in Anna Karenina: We have multiple sequences of translations etc. The true "text" is what did the author mean to say. We find it from the cultural period where the author may have been, as well as insights from other texts by the author. 


>[!abstract]+ Definition: Realism
>is a system of cultural conventions
>The real and the human experience is knowable to the developing hard and natural sciences, not to the abstract reason.

>[!abstract]+ Definition: Textuality
>How texts make meaning, and how texts are organized. Text is the physical books as we know them, but that is a material carrier of a lot of linguistic signs. 


>[!abstract]+ Definition: Overdetermination
>Meaning manifests itself by repeating the same symbols, the same words over and over again. It is overdetermined. Communication is possible only when it is redundant, language must be redundant. If we don't track this, we are analyzing our own individual idiosyncrasies, we have to interpret based off of a consistent pattern repeating throughout the text.


>[!abstract]+ Definition: Dialogism/Polyphony, Bakhtin
>A person entering the world always enters in the middle of someone else speaking, there are thousands of years of various statements and acts. All of those statements uttered are responding to past acts. Polyphony describes how consciousness/experience begins when a person enters the dialogic conversation in the middle.  

>[!abstract]+ Definition: The Real, the Imaginary, The Symbolic, Lacan:
>The real is impossible, the imaginary is the mirror stage. We use the available language to explain what we are to other people 

>[!abstract]+ Definition: Mirror Stage and Identification, Lacan
>The way in which human subjects identify or misidentify themselves as individual or distinct from others. The process by which human subjects compare themselves to visual models of what a person is. 

>[!abstract]+ Definition: Desire, Lacan
> The object of desire is (happiness, self sacrifice, social justice, spiritual purity) etc. The objective of desire is to continue desire, to self reproduce. The real is impossible, we can't figure out what a person experiences. The imaginary and symbolic provide too many opportunities for identification and misidentification. People are always trying to satisfy the real, so we are caught in the endless attempts to keep, reidentify, or explain more precisely. 

>[!abstract]+ Definition: Interpellation, Althusser
>When a character identifies someone else as a figure, subsuming their character into a model of self understanding. They impose a set of rules within which they must negotiate.
