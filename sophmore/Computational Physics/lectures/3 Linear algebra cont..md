## Hermitian matrix:
$$
\begin{align}
\mathbb{H} =\tilde{H}=(\mathbb{H} ^{*})^{T}
\end{align}
$$
Hermitian matrices represent physically observable quantities, i.e. angular momentum, Hamiltonian (energy), etc. 

## Unitary matrices

At low energy physics, we need to conserve the number of particles in a system, so if we are performing a transformation we have to conserve the lengths and just do some complex notion of a rotation. 

$$
\begin{align}
\mathbb{U} =e^{i \mathbb{H} }
\end{align}
$$
(doing the Taylor expansion of $e$ with the matrix where $\mathbb{H}$ is Hermitian) will always yield a unitary matrix
