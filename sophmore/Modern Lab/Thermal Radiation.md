It has been proposed that blackbodies will radiate energy proportional to their temperature. 

We are attempting to test the Stephan-Boltzmann theory that the power irradiated by a black body is proportional to $T^{4}$. We will attempt to use a thermistor as a model for a blackbody and measure the energy balance of the system, and find the relationship between the temperature of the thermistor and the irradiated power.

## Theory of note
There are three methods of energy transfer - convection, conduction, and radiation. To reduce the effects of the first two methods, we will have our measuring apparatus held in a near vacuum. We can't fully remove conduction as a source of leaking power however, since there are copper wires attached to our thermistor to supply power. These can carry energy from the outside world or transfer energy from the system, depending on the relative temperatures inside vs outside. 

Power through a circuit element is given by $I^{2}R$, where $I$ is the current through the element and $R$ is the resistance of the element. 
## Experimental setup

We have a variable resistor followed in series by a the thermistor. The thermistor is inside of a brass cavity that is held near vacuum by a vacuum pump. We surround the brass cavity with different temperature liquids - room temperature water (22 degrees Celsius), cold water (with ice held at 0 degrees Celsius ), and liquid nitrogen (-196 degrees Celcius). We will use the room temperature water and cold water to calibrate the thermistor, and the liquid nitrogen to measure the power radiated from the thermistor. The liquid nitrogen will minimize energy transfer We let the system rest upon each change to allow it to come to thermal equilibrium.

To measure We have two volt meters measuring the voltage drop across two resistors. 

## Experimental procedure

### Thermistor calibration
First we must calibrate our experimental setup. We must find the resistance to temperature relation for our thermistor, which we are using as our 'blackbody' model. To get this calibration curve, we know that the resistance of the thermistor is given by $R_{t}=ae^{ \frac{b}{t} }$. We must find the coefficients $a\text{ and } b$. To do this, we will measure the output voltage from the thermistor at two different power levels and at two different temperatures. The two temperatures will yield a system of equations to solve for the coefficients. We can check for effects of self heating by repeating at a higher current flowing through. If we see a noticeable difference, then self-heating is prohibitive to this experimental procedure. If not, we may proceed.

$R_{1}$ is constant at 10000 $\Omega$. The resistor in our current supply is set to 999999 $\Omega$. We measured the voltage drops at both volt-meters in room temperature water (21.9 C). We then changed the resistance of our variable resistor that is part of the current supply to $199999\Omega$. We waited for ~15 minutes for the system to come to thermal equilibrium, then recorded the voltage at both volt-meters. 

We then replaced our room temperature water with an ice slurry, and waited for 15 minutes for the system to come to thermal equilibrium. We recorded the voltages, and reverted our variable resistor back to $999999\Omega$, and recorded again.
