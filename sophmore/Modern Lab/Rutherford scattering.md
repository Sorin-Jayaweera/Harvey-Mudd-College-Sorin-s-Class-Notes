## Experiment Introduction:

We are attempting to shoot alpha particles at a thin gold sheet and measure any interaction between the two by observing if there is any deflection of the particles.  If there is no interaction, then the alpha particles would continue straight, and we would not observe any alpha particles in our detector. We do this to test the Rutherford and Thompson models of the atom. By measuring any deflection, we may rule out Thompson's plum pudding model, and the relationship between the probability of detecting an alpha particle at a given deflection will test Rutherford's model.

## Experimental Setup:
We set an alpha particle source (Americium 241) at one end of our test apparatus, with an inset disk that has empty space around the edges. There is a thin layer of gold foil "scatterer" laying on the edge of our disk, and a particle detector centered in the tube beyond the scatterer. The tube is evacuated with an air pump to prevent the alpha particles from decaying. When a particle is detected, we detect pass the output voltage from our detector to a pre-amplifier that applies filtering, to an amplifier and single channel analyzer.  


The Rutherford model predicts the probability of detecting a particle between $\theta \text{ and } \theta+d\theta$ as:

## Experimental procedure:
We set the plunger to a desired distance, and record the time that it takes to detect ~100 alpha particles in the detector. 


Error correction: 
The farther the detector from the source, the smaller the range of angles that the alpha particles could be deflected and still be detected at the end of our tube. We must therefore perform a correction of the probability based off of the distance that the alpha particles must travel.  

The size of the detector appears to decrease with $\frac{1}{d^{2}}$ as it were viewed head on - This is the area of a circle varying with the "radius" of the circle as a portion of the field of view.  When the angles deflected are sharp, the line of sight of the detector also takes effect (approaching at an angle makes the effective "shadow" of the detector smaller), where the projected area falls as $\cos\theta$, which can be approximated as $\left( \frac{d_{2}}{D} \right)\left( \frac{1}{D^{2}} \right)$

Fig 1A: External view of our physical setup. We have a vacuum pump (annotated A), a plunger to vary the distance from the detector to the gold annulus (B), the detector (C). The internal tube is covered by steel blocks to prevent accidental radiation poisoning.
