We can plug in to
$$
\begin{align}
B_{ba r} = \frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi} \frac{2Mr}{(r^{2}-b^{2})^{2}} 
\end{align}
$$
Using $r=33.1$ cm, b( distance between 'monopoles' = $3.2$ cm), $m=101.37$ gets $B_{ba r}=0.000569$, which is the same as the field strength generated by the coil.
$B_{bar}=B_{coil}$. We can rearrange
$$
\begin{align}
B_{coil} =\frac{\mu_{0} N i}{2R}
\end{align}
$$
Here, $N =14$, $R=32.8$ cm.
$$
\begin{align}
i= \frac{B_{coil} *2R}{\mu_{0} N}
\end{align}
$$
Plugging in our determined value for $B_{coil}$, we get $i=10.5202$
