We will attempt to establish the ampere as a standard unit in terms of Length, Mass, and time. 

It has been proposed that there is a relation between current in a wire (in amperes) and the magnetic field that is produced:
$$
\begin{align}
d\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi} \frac{id\vec{l}\times  \hat{r}}{r^{2}}
\end{align}
$$

We will attempt to measure the magnetic field around a loop of wire in order to find an independent determination of the Ampere. 

We can rearrange this expression to be
$$
\begin{align}
i = \frac{\left( 4\pi r^{2} d\vec{B} \right)}{\mu_{0}\,  d\vec{l} \times   \hat{r}}
\end{align}
$$

To do this, we have to find the magnetic field produced by the loop of wire. We must be careful though, since there will also be the effect of the local magnetic field from local objects in our room + the earth. 

We can measure the strength of the field produced by our loop of wire by finding the distance that a bar magnet must be to cancel out its field. If we know the strength of that bar magnet, we can get the strength of the wire loop. We can get the strength of this bar magnets with two experiments, one which will yield the ratio of the bar magnet's strength with the local magnetic field, and one which will yield the product of those two values. From that, we can calculate the strength of the bar magnet. From this and the distance that the bar magnet had to be from our current loop to cancel out its field, we can find the magnetic moment of the current loop. Finally, with this value we can plug in and get a value for $i$. This gives us a ratio which will allow us to represent the value of $1$ ampere in terms of fundamental units. 

We can get the ratio of the bar magnets magnetic field and the local field by finding how much a magnet will deflect with the bar at various distances, from not interacting to being very close. 

We can get the product of the magnetic fields from the bar magnet and the local magnetic field by measuring the frequency of oscillation of the bar magnet when suspended from a wire.

We can use the product and the ratio between the bar magnet's field and the local field to find the strength of the field produced by the coil of wires, which we will then use to establish a value for I in amperes. 

On the next few pages, I will provide pictures of the initial setup. We will perform three experiments: One where we find the strength of field produced by the wire coil, one where we compare the relative strengths of the local field and the bar magnet, and one where we measure the frequency of oscillation of the bar magnet when acted on by the local field. After each of my writings for those sub experiments, I will provide all relevant photos for the experimental setup. 


Note for future time travelers: For this experiment, we will use a constant current supply of ___ Ampres,  although this will be used just as a way of driving electron flow. We won't be using this value, as it would yield a circular definition of Ampres. We can check our calculations against this for the experiment, but we are assuming that we don't have knowledge of the current being provided. Huzzah!

I will now provide photos of our measuring apparatus. A chart will be labeled with letters corresponding to each piece of equipment, which label the photos as needed.
