## Theory of Note

A hanging bar magnet would experience a torque $\vec{\tau}= \vec{M}\times \vec{B_{h}}$
The magnitude of this torque is $MB_{h}$. We can use this in conjunction with our earlier value of $\frac{M}{B_{h}}$ to get $M^{2}$, which we can finally use to get the value of $1$ ampere.

$MB_{h}= 4\pi^{2}f^{2}I$

## Experiment

We let the bar magnet rest for 5 minutes after we set it on the table so that it would not wobble as much from us setting it up. We then used an external magnet to exert a torque on the hanging magnet, removed the external magnet after the internal one was rotating sufficiently, and then recorded the time that it took to rotate 20 times - 1:49 (min:sec).  This gets $0.183$ cycles per second. We did this measurement again, resetting it with the magnet. This yielded 40 rotations in 3:40. This gets 0.181 cycles per second. 

The bar magnet weights 0.022 kg, with length 0.064 m. Moment of inertia is given by $\frac{m(L^{2}+s^{2})}{14}$ for a square rod rotating about its center (long arms stretching to either side, swiveling. Not rotating around the axis that goes through the long way) in the same manner as our magnet is. $I=7.6*10^{-6}$
$$
\begin{align}
MB_{h} & = 4\pi^{2}f^{2}I \\
 & =1.26*10^{-5}
\end{align}
$$
We can now combine these two to find $M$:

|                |             |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| MB             | 0.0000127   |
| M/B            | 808278430   |
| M^2 = M/B * MB | 10276.35258 |
| M              | 101.3723462 |

This M gives us $B_{bar}$ at the distance that it was able to cancel out the field generated by the coil.
