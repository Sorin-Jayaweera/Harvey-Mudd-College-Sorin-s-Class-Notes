We are now able to define a current $i$ as
$$
\begin{align}
i = \frac{\mu_{0}  rRM}{4 \pi(r^{2}-b^{2})^{2}}
\end{align}
$$

This gives the unit of amps as
$$
\begin{align}
[A]  & = \left[ \frac{m^{2} Am^{2} \frac{N}{A^{2}}}{m^{4}} \right] \\
[A]^{2} &  = N \\
  A & = \sqrt[]{ kg \frac{M}{s^{2}} } 
\end{align}
$$
We now have a definition for an ampere. We have derived the relationship for our specific experimental setup, which can be generalized. 1 Ampere of current is the current required for a 14 coil, 0.164 meter radius inductor to generate a magnetic field of equivalent to a magnet with dipole moment $m= 6.33*10^{-1}$  being placed at 2.859 cm.
