Today, we reset our experiment and took a fully new set of data. Refer to the previous pages for the necessary equations and in depth justification of each step along our procedure.  


## Brief recap of theory:

$$
\begin{align}
B_{coil} = \frac{\mu_{0}Ni}{2R}
\end{align}
$$
$$
\begin{align}
B_{bar} = \frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi} \frac{2Mr}{(r^{2}-b^{2})^{2}} 
\end{align}
$$

We have an experiment that will yield $B_{\text{ magnet }}*B_{\text{ local }}$, from the rotational frequency of a magnet, and $\frac{B_{\text{ magnet }}}{B_{\text{ local }}}$ from the deflection of the magnetic field by our magnet at various distances. We can use these to find $B_{\text{ magnet }}$ (which we also label $B_{\text{ bar }}$). We then measure distances that the Bar's magnetic field cancels the coil's magnetic field, and we have an expression for the current in the wire in terms of fundamental units.

## Experiment
First, we marked the location of our magnetic loop, and prepared the same as before. We used magnet # 10 this time. 

With the coil turned off, we took measurements of the angle of deflection of the needle at increments of 5 centimeters starting from 50 cm away. With this, we were able to calculate M of the bar / B of the local magnetic field. 

Note, that the magnetic center of our compass was not centered at the markings of our scale (around 50 cm). We found the magnetic center by measuring the distance from the the compass that our magnet had to be on either side to yield an equivalent deflection, and found the actual center of the magnet. 

We then set the magnet in a swing in the same location as the compass was, without the coil apparatus. We held other magnets to ensure the north pole was facing north and the magnet was stable, then released our grasp on the floating magnet by carefully moving our external magnets away. The magnet then flipped around and began oscillating. We waited a minute for this to stabilize, and then recorded how long it took the magnet to rotate 75 times, which gave us m* b from the previous equations. 

Using these, we were able to rearrange to calculate i. 

Finally, we turned on the magnetic coil at 400 mA, 500 mA, 600 mA and 698 mA. For each of these, we measured the distance that our bar magnet had to be from the magnetic center to cancel out the field from the coils.

We know that
$$
\begin{align}
B_{coil} = B_{bar}, \\
\text{ so} \\
\frac{\mu_{0}Ni}{2R} = \frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi} \frac{2Mr}{(r^{2}-b^{2})^{2}}  \\
i = \frac{RMr}{\pi(r^{2}-b^{2})^{2}N}
\end{align}
$$
From this, we are able to establish a measurement for the current in our electrical circuit in terms of fundamental quantities.

M, the magnetic dipole moment, has units of $Am^{2}$. $r$ and $b$ have units of length. $\mu_{0}$ has units of $\frac{N}{A^{2}}$.
