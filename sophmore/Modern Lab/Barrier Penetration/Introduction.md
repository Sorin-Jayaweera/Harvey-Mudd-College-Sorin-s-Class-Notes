## Background
In quantum mechanics there is a theory that waves will have a form of "tunneling", which has an optical analog of barrier penetration called "frustrated total internal reflection". Taking a block of some material with index of refraction > 1, a wave will transmit through it and escape. If the wave goes through a right triangular block, however, it would reflect off of the $45$ degree angle. If a square is cut along a diagonal and slowly separated, the optical analog of tunneling may become apparent - where some of the wave transmits through the blocks, and some is reflected.

## Our experiment
Today, we will attempt to test the theory that the fraction of intensity for microwave radiation through this type of system would follow the relation
$$
\begin{align}
T = (1+\alpha \sinh ^{2} \beta d)^{-1}
\end{align}
$$

Where $T$ is the fraction of intensity, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants of the system, and $d$ is the separation between the blocks. We determine these two constants for our system in the "Calibration" section of this lab notebook.

The coefficients are given by
$$
\begin{align}
\alpha= \frac{(n^{2}-1)^{2}}{n^{2}(n^{2}-2)} \\
\beta= \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\sqrt[]{ \frac{n^{2}-2}{2} } 
\end{align}
$$
where $n$ is the index of refraction of polyethylene (which we are using as our block), and $\lambda$ is the wavelength in air. 

## Layout of this notebook

I will detail our calibration of the microwave emitter and receiver in the "Calibration" section. In this, we will find the receiver characteristic -weather it follows the intensity of the electromagnetic wave, or the field strength, and the frequency of microwaves that are emitted by our equipment. We will also find the index of refraction of of material, polyethylene, in the section "Index of Refraction".

We will then test the hypothesis in the "Testing the Hypothesis" section.
