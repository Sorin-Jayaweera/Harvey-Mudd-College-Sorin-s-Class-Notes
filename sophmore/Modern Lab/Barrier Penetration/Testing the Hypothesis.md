## Theory 

We want to measure the intensity of microwaves that pass through a cube that has been split in half, given the separation between the two halves. In the limit where the two halves of our cube are far apart, nearly all incoming waves should be reflected off of the hypotenuse. In the limit where they are close together - touching - the waves should primarily be transmitted through. We are attempting to test the relationship between intensity of the transmitted wave and the separation between our two blocks.

Again, we are trying to test the relation 
$$
\begin{align}
T=(1-\alpha\sinh(d \,  \beta))^{-1}
\end{align}
$$
See introduction for the definition of $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
## Experimental setup


We have a transmitter at one side of our barriers, and a receiver at a constant distance past the other side of the barriers. The barriers are two halves of a cube that is cut along a diagonal (looking from above). We can separate the two halves - right triangular prisms - while measuring the transmitted wave through them to understand the relation between barrier separation and the transmission coefficient.

Aside: Out of curiosity, we also briefly have a receiver that is perpendicular to the line that our microwaves travel, so that we can observe the reflection off of the hypotenuse. We measure the perpendicularly reflected waves (off the hypotenuse) and the waves that are transmitted straight through the block. As predicted by the two limits in theory, when the blocks are touching we measure nearly zero perpendicular reflection and nearly full transmission. When the blocks are far apart, we measure almost entirely perpendicular reflection.

We push the two blocks to touch, and carefully vary the distance of our receiver until it reads a maximum value. We then set our receiver to measure that value as 1, so that as we pull the blocks away, the value we read on the receiver is the transmission coefficient (percentage received relative to the amount typically transmitted). We then slowly separate the blocks, notating the distance and measurement on our receiver.

We use the index of refraction and the wavelength emitted from our setup (found in the calibration and index of refraction sections) to calculate the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ values that were proposed. 

Using index of refraction $n=1.52$, and wavelength = $0.242$ cm, we find
$\alpha=2.39$ and $\beta=1022.846$.


With this, we compare the predicted transmission coefficient with our experimentally determined coefficient.
