We see that, while there are significant error bars, the experimental data and the hypothesized relation agree, with a maximum error
$\frac{T_{\text{ measured }}-T_{\text{ predicted }}}{T_{\text{ measured }}}=5.08\times 10^{-1}$, which is very close relatively. 

As seen on the graph on page 66, the relationship between the predicted $T$ and the experimental value is almost linear, with a high $R^{2}$ value. 

Our data appears to support the hypothesis that the relationship between transmitted intensity and the distance separation between a material is given by
$$
\begin{align}
T = (1+\alpha \sinh ^{2}(\beta d))^{-1}
\end{align}
$$
With 
$$
\begin{align}
\alpha= \frac{(n^{2}-1)^{2}}{n^{2}(n^{2}-2)}
\end{align}
$$
and 
$$
\begin{align}
\beta= \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \sqrt[]{ \frac{n^{2}-2}{2 } } 
\end{align}
$$
where $\lambda$ was the wavelength that we hit the material with, $n$ was the index of refraction, and $d$ was the separation between the two parts of the material.
