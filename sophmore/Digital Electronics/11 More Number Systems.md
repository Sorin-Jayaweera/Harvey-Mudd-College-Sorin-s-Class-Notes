When we want to do addition of numbers, we have to align their exponents and then add, but have to choose an appropriate exponent so that we don't overflow. We then have to convert the answer back to scientific notation. 


some really cool memory stuff that I didn't write down. Look up ROM, RAM, eeprom, flash memory. I was too raptured to take notes, my apologies dear readers. 


"EPROM requires you to shine UV light on the chip itself to erase the chip. Naturally this can't be done on the fly. We also have EEPROMs, which are electronically erasable, but similarly require you to wipe the whole chip before writing to it again." ~yalloc on reddit.
