The engineering process requires a lot of ideation, and a lot of it will take time. There are many ways of going about a solution, and they can be combined or manipulated to work together. Don't be an overbearing / crushing extrovert, and don't get too sold on a single idea. 

Take time to really consider the problem

documentation of things that are going wrong, and careful exploration to solve those miniature tasks is really helpful. DON'T DO EVERYTHING IN  YOUR HEAD, WRITE IT OUT AND THINK THROUGH IT AND FORCE YOURSELF TO PROCESS SOMETHING IN A WAY YOU WOULD ARGUE TO SOMEONE ELSE!

There are a lot of organizational tools that can be really useful.

Feedback for myself
- Improvements
	- I was overbearing and controlled the idea flow too much, constraining how much Sophie was able to give feedback on the design
	- I'm too chaotic and a little unsafe in the makerspace / woodshop
	- I need to do things more rigorously
	- I need to think more before doing things, i.e. weight requirements instead of just size and form factor and stability.
		- Have a more holistic view of the product and all the things that have to work, instead of operating on groundless assumptions
	- 
- Things done well
	- Worked hard + time committed
	- made a nice design that was semi-professional
	- tried to be excited and fun to work with, and it worked
	
Feedback for Sophie
* Improvements
	* I like how we worked together, but I wish we thought of more ideas that weren't just the "stick-cane-pushing" stuff that I was mainly proposing. You should ignore me / explore other solutions, even if they are whimsical or far out. 
	* Don't roll over to my extravert-ness; people can be really stupid even if they sound like they know what they're doing. Its more fun to work with someone that has a large set of ideas and cares about the problem and talks openly about the ideas.
		* Sorry if it sounds like I'm criticizing too much, I can't word this well

- Things done well
	- You came up with the idea of magnets which became the core part of our design.
	- It was fun to work together, which made it easier to put in a lot of time on the design
