Function: The output that we want for some determined input. What the thing needs to do. They are be active (I.E. a table standing still is actively resisting gravity). The thing a design must be able to do or achieve.  Functions are VERB-NOUN pairs, they should be specific. They describe the specific action that a design should do, with the fundamental actions that the device must do. Functions shouldn't imply a specific mean, i.e. remove water instead of mop up water. It also must be the actions specific to the thing, not done by the user. 


Mean: The way that a design will act when given some input to produce the desirable we will output. The components that that function acts through.
