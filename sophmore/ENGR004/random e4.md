 Goal: Improve the DAC by characterizing and optimizing the process through experimentation

Objectives:
- Model the system properly
- Efficient
- scalable
- Proper measurement capabilities
- Constructed in a low carbon process
Constraints:
- Has to be able to properly model the crystallization and separation system
- Has to allow control for density, solid loading, and crystal size
- stay within a budget
- work with modern design
- 

Functions:
- Simulate or perform the separation process
- Allow experimentation in variables
- Measure all parameters in a meaningful way
-
