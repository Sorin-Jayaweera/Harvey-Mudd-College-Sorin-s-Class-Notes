Initial intro on types of particles

Relitavistic quantum mechanics:

We had before
$$
\begin{align}
H_{op} = \frac{P_{op}^{2}}{2m}
\end{align}
$$
which is reminiscent of $E=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$

But really, $E=\sqrt[]{ p^{2}c^{2}+m^{2}c^{4} }$

Also, when we were decaying particles, i.e. $n\to p+e^{-}+ \bar{v}_{e}$, we violate
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{ d }{d t } \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \left| \Psi  \right| ^{2}dx = 0
\end{align}
$$
Because before the neutron decays, we have zero probability of a proton, but after we do. 


## The standard model

There are 4 forces. We already understand gravity and it doesn't really apply on tiny scales because its so weak.

The forces don't come from potential energy functions, they are mediated by the exchange of particles, the force carriers. 

## Electromagnetic Strength
Consider two electrons:
$$
\begin{align}
V(r)= \frac{(-e)^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r}
\end{align}
$$
Lets be crazy, 
$$
\begin{align}
V(r)= \underbrace{ \frac{(-e)^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}\hbar c}  }_{ \text{ dimensionless } } \underbrace{ \frac{\hbar c}{r} }_{ \text{ energy } }
\end{align}
$$
This defines the fine structure constant,
$$
\begin{align}
\alpha_{EM} = \frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}\hbar c} \approx \frac{1}{137}
\end{align}
$$
Because the electromagnetic force is mediated by photons, if I have a particle a meter away from an electron, then there is a photon with a meter wavelength. Same for any length scale. We don't have a classic photon - electromagnetic waves propagating are really just a bunch of photons. The photon is the fundamental thing behind electromagnetism.

We don't have any constraints on the wavelength of the photon:
$$
\begin{align}
E_{\gamma} = h\nu = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \\
\text{ We need } E_{\gamma} \geq  m_{\gamma} c^{2} \\
\frac{hc}{\lambda} \geq 0
\end{align}
$$
So the electromagnetic force can go infinitely far.


Side note: 
We have a generalized potential energy if we want to invent a new force.:
$$
\begin{align}
V(r) = \underbrace{ Q_{1}Q_{2} }_{ \text{ dimensionless charge } } \alpha_{force} \frac{\hbar c}{r}
\end{align}
$$


## Weak force
The weak force is mediated by the $W^{\pm },Z^{0}$. 
These are massive particles, so there is a limit on the range.
$$
\begin{align}
V_{w} (r)= Q_{1}^{w}Q_{2}^{w}\alpha_{weak} \left( \frac{\hbar}{r} \right) e^{-cm_{\omega}r/\hbar }
\end{align}
$$
This has a cutoff for distance given by
$$
\begin{align}
r \geq \left( c \frac{M_{\omega}}{\hbar} \right)^{-1} \approx 10^{-17}m 
\end{align}
$$
This is $0.01$ times the size of a photon. 


Note that the coupling constant $\alpha$ depends in some way on charge. 

## Strong force
Mediated by a massless gluon. There are 3 types of charge. The left over force that barely extends outside the nucleus is what we talked about with fusion and fission, bringing nucleons closer together. 

The strong force gets stronger the further away. Quarks and gluons get stuck together at low energies or long distance, since the $\alpha$ gets bigger the lower the energy. Weird.
