Lets recall the basics of quantum optics.

However, if were dealing with a single photon, what is its wavelength?

For constructive interference, we want the difference in distance between the path lengths to be an integer multiple of the wavelength.

We can check that this works for both the classical and wavelike prediction.

$P=zz^{*}=4r^{2}\cos ^{2}\left( kd \frac{\sin\theta}{2} \right)$.

## Matter double split

What if we do the double slit with non relativistic matter particles?
Taking a helium atom, we can find its wavelength.

However, the helium had to be really slow for this. The faster it is, the smaller the wavelength ($p=\frac{h}{\lambda}$) ($p\text{ is momentum }$). There is also diffraction through each path within a single split that gives us the envelope.
