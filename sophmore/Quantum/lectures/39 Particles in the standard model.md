## Particles made of quarks -- Hadrons
Must be colorless

Mesons are quark - antiquark pairs

Baryons are three quarks rgb and must be colorless.


## Forces Via Particle Exchange

This is a new way of thinking. 

A positron moving forwards in time is the same as an electron moving backwards in time?

Feynman diagrams hold even if rotated.

The number of vertices is related to the probability that something happens. 

We add up the probabilities of everything happening.

These vertexes all interact via the strong force, where each node is dependent on $\sqrt[]{ \alpha }$.
## Weak Interactions
We describe with the same formalism, but add a weak vertex.

We have $w^{+}\text{ and } w^{-}$ particles that mediate the interaction in the same way that photons did.

Remember, Up types have $+\frac{2}{3}e$ and  Down types are $-\frac{1}{3}$.
