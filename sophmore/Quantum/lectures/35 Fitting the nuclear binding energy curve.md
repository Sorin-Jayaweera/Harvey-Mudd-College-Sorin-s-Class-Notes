The binding energy 
$$
\begin{align}
E_{b} = a_{1}A - a_{2}A^{\frac{2}{3}} - a_{3} \frac{z^{2}}{A^{\frac{1}{3}}} - a_{4} \left[ Z-\frac{A}{2} \right]^{2} + a_{5} \left( \frac{1}{A^{\frac{1}{2}}} \right) \begin{cases}
1  &  \text{ z and n are even } \\
0  &  \text{ z and n are eve/odd } \\
-1 & \text{ z and n are odd }\\
\end{cases}
\end{align}
$$

Lets figure out what each term means:

The first three terms form from a Liquid drop model. They stick together like a drop of water, where nuclei are spherical, constant density, an attractive nearest neighbor force, and a repulsive electrostatic force. 

There is force in packing them in a volume, force for their surface contact, and repulsive coulombic force.

For the fourth term, the fermi gas model.
Why can't we just slap a bunch of neutrons together? They're fermions, and have to stack up energies for them to be in the same states.

The minimization happens at $\frac{A}{2}$.
