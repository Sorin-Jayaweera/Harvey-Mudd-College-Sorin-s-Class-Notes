Note: $m_{n} \geq n_{p} + m_{e}$

Free neutrons are unstable. We have the nuclear reaction:
$$
\begin{align}
n \to   p+e^{-} + \bar{u}_{e} 
\end{align}
$$
where $\bar{u}_{e}$ is an anti neutrino
The half life of a neutron is about 10 minutes. 


##### Notation:
Nuclei: $^{A}_{Z}X$: $A$ is the atomic mass, $Z$ is the number of protons, $X$ is an element symbol, $N_{\text{ neutrons }}=A-Z$. 


The mass given is the average stable terrestrial (naturally occurring) isotope. 

How would we probe to get the size of the nucleus? Light would need a wavelength smaller than the nucleus, but $R_{neucleus} \ll \lambda _\text{ light }$.
