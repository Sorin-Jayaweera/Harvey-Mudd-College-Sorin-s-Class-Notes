\begin{align}
\frac{H_{\text{ int }}}{h} = \frac{g_{e} \mu_{B} }{h}(B^{\dagger}S)= \bar{\gamma_{NV} B^{\dagger}S}

$$
\begin{align}
\Delta \nu = \frac{2g_{e} \mu_{B} }{h}B_{z} = 2 \bar{\gamma_{NV} B_{z} }

$$
where $g_{e}=2.003$ is the NV electronic Lande factor, $\mu B$ is the Bohr magnetron, and $S^{\dagger}=(S_{x},S_{y},S_{z})$, the dimensionless electronic spin-1 operator. 
$B_{z}$ is the magnetic field along the axis between the nitrogen and the vacancy.



To understand the Zeeman effect, first we must understand the effect of a magnetic field on a moving charged particle. Consider an electron orbiting in a circle with speed $v$ and period $T=\frac{2\pi r}{v}$ .If an external magnetic field is applied, the torque experienced by the electron will be given by $\tau=\mu \times B$, where $\mu$ is the magnetic dipole moment of the electron loop. This restoring torque will act to align the magnet with the direction of the field. This exerts work, where
$$
\begin{align}
dW = \tau d\theta = \mu B\sin\theta d\theta = d(-\mu B\cos) = d(-\mu\cdot B)
\end{align}
$$
Therefore, by forcefully aligning the electron's orbit with the magnetic field, there is a change in potential energy given by $U=-\mu\cdot B$.

From electrodynamics, take the magnetic dipole moment $\mu$ to be $\mu=IA$. Because we have a single electron flowing around the perimeter of our circle, $\mu= \frac{qrv}{2}$ We can multiply this by $\frac{m}{m}$ to get $\mu= \frac{e}{2m}\left| L \right|$. 

Therefore, the potential energy for a single electron orbiting in a loop from a magnetic field is
$U=-\mu\cdot B=-\frac{e}{2m}L\cdot B$. This can be added to the Hamiltonian operator for an electron as $\frac{eB}{2m}L_{z_{op}}$.



$L_{z_{op}}Y_{l,lm}= m_{l}\hbar Y_{l,ml}$.



$\mu=g\left( -\frac{e}{2m} \right)S$, where $S$ is the intrinsic spin angular momentum.
